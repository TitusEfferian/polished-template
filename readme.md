# Polished Template
A [Polished Admin](https://polaris.shopify.com/) toolkit based on [Bootstrap v4](http://getbootstrap.com/).

Shopify Polaris is a great way to make apps for Shopify that provide a consistent feel to the whole ecosystem, however it is heavily geared towards React and doesn't have very clean or semantic markup. Bootstrap Polaris is meant to keep that consistent UX while using light semantic and accessible markup, while removing the need for a front end JS framework.
